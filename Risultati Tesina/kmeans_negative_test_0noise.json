            "headline": "First woman: Smithsonian Air and Space director looks from the moon to Mars",
            "bodyText": "On the red carpet beneath an Apollo lunar module and Charles Lindbergh\u2019s Spirit of St Louis, actors Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy mingled with astronauts, Nasa engineers and members of the US Congress. Washington was staging the national premiere of a Neil Armstrong biopic. But before it saw First Man, it heard from the first woman. Ellen Stofan made history this summer when she became the first female director of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, the third-most-visited museum in the world after the National Museum of China and the Louvre in Paris. More than 8.6m people passed through its doors last year and 350m have done so since it opened in 1976, a total higher than the US population. Before a popcorn-chewing audience in the museum\u2019s Imax cinema, Stofan introduced the ravishingly shot film that recreates Armstrong\u2019s small step for man in 1969. He was the first of 12 people to walk on the lunar surface: all Americans, all white, all men. As Nasa turns its eyes to Mars, Stofan has a different vision. \u201cI hope this museum inspires the first woman to step foot on Mars, and I hope she\u2019s the first person to step foot on Mars,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cResearch shows that diverse teams perform better than non-diverse teams, multi-gender teams perform better, and so why wouldn\u2019t you do this? It\u2019s an imperative to make sure that we\u2019re doing our best.\u201d The museum\u2019s flagship site in Washington, which has a prominent exhibit about Sally Ride, the first American woman in space, is about to undergo a seven-year, $900m renovation that will include structural upgrades and new galleries drawing on the collection of more than 65,000 objects. Under Stofan, it is a safe bet the displays will be sensitive to America\u2019s changing demographics. \u201c[Civil rights and children\u2019s activist] Marian Wright Edelman said: \u2018You can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see\u2019, and I do believe that,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I was growing up, I knew I wanted to be a scientist and I would look for stories of women scientists and they were pretty few and far between. So I think it\u2019s incredibly important for any child who comes into the museum, whether it\u2019s a Latino boy, whether it\u2019s a Hispanic girl, whether it\u2019s an African American girl, to see stories of themselves. \u201cMy position as director of the museum, I hope, does allow girls to say: \u2018That\u2019s a thing girls do, not something that\u2019s foreign.\u2019 Obviously the aerospace industry historically has been dominated by men and you could say: \u2018Well, why does that matter?\u2019 To me it\u2019s because you\u2019re leaving talent on the table and you\u2019re really not tapping into the talent of all your population. If we want to move forward, be innovative and know what\u2019s the next Wright Flyer and who are the people who are going to work on the next form of getting people to Mars, we need that workforce, we need kids to get inspired and say: \u2018I can do that.\u2019\u201d \u2018I went to my first launch when I was four\u2019 Our interview takes place at the 15-year-old Steven F Udvar-Hazy center in Chantilly, Virginia, where vast hangars contain an Air France Concorde, the space shuttle Discovery and the B-29 bomber Enola Gay, which dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima. Stofan speaks in an airy boardroom graced by the museum\u2019s little-known Apollo-era art collection, including a Norman Rockwell painting, Astronauts Grissom and Young Suiting Up. It soon becomes clear Stofan has star stuff in her blood. She grew up in Ohio, the home of Armstrong and other pioneers. Her father was a Nasa rocket scientist, her mother an elementary school science teacher. \u201cI went to my first launch when I was four, which is why I have such an incredible affinity for rockets and launches,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI always had an interest in science but I really didn\u2019t think of Nasa as a career path because everybody who worked there looked like my dad. \u201cMy dad was in charge of the rocket that launched the Viking landers to Mars and [TV astronomer] Carl Sagan was talking about going to Mars and searching for life and I was like, \u2018OK, that\u2019s cool, I want to do that.\u2019 So at age 14 I decided to become a planetary scientist. I think that role model business is incredibly important.\u201d After university she joined Nasa\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, working on the Magellan Mission to Venus and the New Millennium Program, where she managed a hundred scientists working on new technologies. She lived in the UK for eight years and is an honorary professor at University College London; her youngest daughter just graduated from Edinburgh University. For 13 years, Stofan was vice-president and senior scientist at a Washington consulting firm specialising in planetary research. From 2013 to 2016, she was chief scientist at Nasa, where her work included helping develop a long-range plan to get humans to Mars. At 57, she is part of a generation that might have had reasonable expectation of exploring the red planet. Although robots have got there it is, she says, \u201cincredibly frustrating\u201d that Mars remains out of reach to humankind. She believes Nasa is on track to send a crew to the surface by the late 2030s, with potential to get into orbit sooner. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about this a lot at the museum because we\u2019re really focused for the next year on the 50th anniversary of the Apollo missions,\u201d she says. \u201cYou had this charismatic president [John F Kennedy] who set this very specific goal \u2013 we\u2019ll land a human on the moon within a decade \u2013 and that goal motivated everything. The initial rocketry programme had started but they had to invent new math and build incredible infrastructure and that took a lot of money. \u201cSo it was a combination of a specific goal, the will to follow through on that specific goal and money and also, frankly, an attitude about risk. If you add those things together \u2013 budget, will, risk posture \u2013 that\u2019s why we are not yet on Mars. I get frustrated sometimes when I hear people say: \u2018Oh, we don\u2019t have the technology.\u2019 If we had the will to get to the moon in eight years starting from where we started from, we could get to Mars.\u201d Despite the vast distance and the vast expense of getting there, crewed missions to Mars have been put back on the political agenda by Donald Trump, who revived the National Space Council under the chairmanship of the vice-president, Mike Pence. Stofan says: \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of positive momentum right now. So you say, all right, can we just keep it moving forward and that\u2019s what everybody\u2019s waiting to see.\u201d Pence has a tendency to use combative, jingoistic language about putting \u201cAmerican boots on the face of Mars\u201d and ensuring American dominance in space, echoing the way the cold war-era lunar landing was regarded as a statement of US supremacy. Stofan is more diplomatic, noting that Nasa is among more than a dozen space agencies working on a roadmap that leads from the international space station to the moon and then Mars. She says: \u201cWhen I was at Nasa we certainly spent a lot of time talking to our foreign partners about do you want to partner on going back to the moon, do you want to partner on going to Mars, and so I have no doubt that that first crew will be an international crew. The best, the smartest, the most innovative people are located all over the world, so if you\u2019re going to do something audacious \u2013 it is still pretty darn difficult to get humans to Mars and safely back home again \u2013 you\u2019re going to need to get the talent of all the world involved and I\u2019m sure it will be an international mission.\u201d As for the president\u2019s controversial plan to create a space force, the museum has artifacts reflecting how governments have used space for national security purposes for decades. \u201cSo if there is a space force then we\u2019ll be able to put that in its historical context,\u201d Stofan says. What I do think is important is Nasa is a civilian space agency. It\u2019s about exploration, it\u2019s about science, it\u2019s about discovery. I\u2019s always existed side by side with the military but not connected and that\u2019s something I certainly hope continues going forward.\u201d \u2018An incredible platform\u2019 But for an institution that was supposed to be about futuristic, cosmic ambitions and instilling a sense of wonder, the Air and Space\u2019s lead building is starting to creak as it approaches its mid-40s, with moisture creeping in and damaging the interior structure. A rebuild of the shell, along with new entrance security glass and a new heating and cooling system, has been ordered at a cost of $650m provided by Congress. A refit of the galleries inside will cost a further $250m, raised through private philanthropy, a big part of Stofan\u2019s job. Some 1,400 objects will go on display for the first time, including a Martin B-26 Marauder plane nicknamed \u201cFlak-Bait\u201d, which survived 207 missions over Europe, more than any other American aircraft during the second world war. Its pilot, James Farrell, named the shot-up bomber after \u201cFlea Bait\u201d, his brother\u2019s nickname for the family dog. Stofan says: \u201cTo me, especially coming from my background, this place is an incredible platform to say how do you really energise the next generation around science, technology, engineering and math, and to me if it\u2019s not just something that I\u2019m passionate about, it\u2019s future workforce. How do we get kids to realise these future careers in aviation and aerospace?\u201d The golden anniversary of the Apollo missions represents one small step. On 11 October, Apollo 7 pilot Walt Cunningham was present for the unveiling of a commemorative coin design. A week-long celebration is planned for July 2019, including the return of Armstrong\u2019s Apollo 11 spacesuit for the first time in 13 years following conservation funded by thousands of public donations. But Stofan is also looking forward. \u201cIf we have just a total retrospective celebration we\u2019re going to lose this opportunity to inspire this next generation to say \u2018Let\u2019s make this Mars landing happen,\u2019\u201d she insists. \u201cI also think it\u2019s a good time to reflect on what we\u2019re capable of as humankind. To me, the space programme really is the better angels of our nature. Right now there\u2019s incredible international cooperation in space and that is what\u2019s going to help us get back to the moon and on to Mars. That was not really a factor during Apollo. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about what\u2019s different now and how positive that is, and how sending humans on this great voyage to Mars would be an incredible achievement for humankind, and an incredible positive achievement.\u201d First Man hit US cinemas this week"

            "headline": "The first human on Mars should be a woman \u2013 we deserve stardust too",
            "bodyText": "What do the names Kalpana Chawla, Mae Jemison, Valentina Tereshkova and Sally Ride mean to you? Until fairly recently, the names of these female space pioneers didn\u2019t mean much to me. Despite being obsessed with all things space as a six-year-old girl, who thought a day out at the Jodrell Bank Observatory was as exciting as a trip to Disney World, I was never taught about them. I didn\u2019t know that Dr (!) Tereshkova was the first woman to fly into space, that she was 26 when she went, and that when she took off she said, \u201cHey, sky! Take off your hat, I\u2019m coming!\u201d Nor did I know that Dr Chawla was the first Indian-born woman to go into space and that after she died in the Columbia disaster they named a hill on Mars after her. A senior Nasa engineer, Allison McIntyre, said this week that the first person on Mars should be a woman. And she\u2019s right, because despite the incredible work of many female scientists and engineers involved in space exploration, there has historically been a \u201cspace gap\u201d. When Nasa was founded in 1958, it had an all-male staff. The only humans to have walked on the moon have been men. It was literally one giant leap for mankind. As for womankind: while there has been progress, we still have a long way to go. According to a 2014 report, women make up a mere 9% of those working in non-medical science, a statistic that makes Nasa\u2019s one third-female staff look astonishingly progressive. Nasa is light years away from where it started: in 2016, it selected its first gender-balanced cohort of astronauts and it has a number of outreach programmes geared towards inspiring girls. We are also starting to see the traditional under-appreciation of women\u2019s role in space being addressed in wider culture, from films such as Hidden Figures, which tells the story of the three female Nasa \u201chuman computers\u201d working in the 1950s-60s, to the women featured in books such as Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls and A Galaxy of Her Own. But Nasa being one-third female isn\u2019t good enough, and women still face barriers when it comes to representation in science, technology, engineering and maths. They face biases both explicit and unconscious, which can affect them throughout their careers, impacting whether they get research grants and lab space. There is a clear gender gap that opens up at age 16; before then, equal numbers of boys and girls study sciences. This gap gets wider the further up you go \u2013 we make up only a small proportion of professors. There is much that can be done about this, such as peer-reviewing hiring decisions, but the pace of change is agonisingly slow. A woman being the first person on Mars would not solve all this. But what a statement for Nasa to make. The gravity of it makes my head spin. Perhaps it is a failure of imagination on my part but the feeling of watching a woman become the first human to walk on Mars \u2026 I can\u2019t imagine how it would make me and millions of other women and girls feel. How does it feel to watch a person of your gender set foot on a faraway celestial body for the first time? Could you write to me, men, and let me know? And while it wouldn\u2019t make up for all the gender injustice in the world, it would be a damn good start. It would make a statement to the planet \u2013 not to mention possible life on other planets \u2013 that women are as deserving of stardust as men. I know I shouldn\u2019t get my hopes up; after all, look at what happened with Hillary Clinton. But nonetheless, this is my plea to Nasa: make a woman the first human in history to set foot on Mars. For six-year-old me. For all of us. \u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist"

            "headline": "Trump's moon shot might be steered by a woman, says Nasa chief",
            "bodyText": "There is at least a one in three chance that the first human to set foot on the moon this century will be a woman, Dr Ellen Ochoa, the head of Nasa\u2019s Johnson space center has said. In the early 1960s Nasa sent out rejection letters saying it had no plans to send women into space. Among those who apparently received the brush-off was a teenage Hillary Clinton. But the agency has since changed its tune, and in 1983 Sally Ride became the first American woman in space. In 2013 Nasa announced that half of its new class of eight astronauts were women \u2013 a first for the agency. The gender split among astronauts means the first step taken on the Moon since the 1970s might well be by a woman. \u201cAbout a third of our active astronauts are women, so chances are at least a third,\u201d said Ochoa, a former astronaut. While relations between the US and Russia were charged as a result of the Trump-Russia investigation, Ochoa said the International Space Station (ISS) was above politics, and not just physically. \u201cIt really hasn\u2019t affected at all our operations with the ISS,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is this bigger goal that both of the countries that people are really involved in working with [the ISS] day to day are really focused on. And I think that really helps.\u201d However she admitted the shift from Barack Obama\u2019s focus on Mars to Donald Trump\u2019s desire to first put boots back on the moon was somewhat disruptive. \u201cWe do talk about how we can make the most efficient use of the taxpayers\u2019 money if we have stability in the goals and where we are headed,\u201d Ochoa said. But, she added, the latest switch would not be a major upheaval. \u201cWe were already planning to do activities in the lunar vicinity to prepare us for Mars, now I think it will be more activity than we were originally thinking but all of the major investments that we have going on are still needed,\u201d she said. \u201c It is not a big left turn or right turn or anything like that, it is a little bit more of a course correction.\u201d Speaking at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Austin, Ochoa also talked about her own time as an astronaut \u2013 \u2013 noting that it was a mental, rather than physical, exertion. \u201cPeople are watching everything that you are doing and so the entire day, everything that you do you are really trying to make sure you are doing everything exactly right,\u201d she said."

Reception was undoubtedly positive during the war, given the advantages of extra forces for Britain. The King, and Emperor of India, George V, sent a message to greet them on their arrival: \u201cI look to all my Indian soldiers to uphold the British Raj against an aggressive and relentless enemy. I know with what readiness my brave and loyal Indian soldiers prepared to fulfil this sacred trust in the field of battle, shoulder to shoulder with their comrades from all parts of my Empire.\u201d Read full article: To the Native Soldiers One particularly interesting letter to the newspaper a month later recognised their participation, urging readers not to forget the Indian soldier\u2019s personal tastes: \u201cThe Indian native soldier would greatly value sugar candy (if possible the Indian Misri), candied cocoanut, aveca nut (Supari) cut in thin slices, cinnamon, and cloves. These things are all highly appreciated by the various Indian races.\u201d Read full article: Comforts for Indian troops The combative qualities of the Indian troops certainly took the German army by surprise. In a letter home published by the Guardian, a German soldier wrote: \u201cToday for the first time we had to fight against the Indians, and the Devil knows those brown rascals are not to be underrated. At first we spoke with contempt of the Indians. Today we learned to look at them in a different light \u2026 With buttends, bayonets, swords and daggers we fought each other, and we had bitter hard work.\u201d By Armistice day, soldiers from the subcontinent had won 11 Victoria Crosses. The Guardian reported the first two on 27 January 1915: Sepoy Khudadad Khan, one of the regimental machine gun section of the 129th Duke of Connaught\u2019s Own Baluchis who single-handedly stopped a German attack during the battle of Ypres, and Naik Darwan Singh Negi, from the First Battalion 39th Garhwalis, who was the first of his regiment to help retake British trenches near Festubert, despite being wounded twice in the head. India was not the only nation from which troops were recruited to aid war efforts. Somewhat less discussed is the African side of the story, despite a large loss of human life and major consequences for the future of the African continent. At one point, the paper put the number of natives for carrier work alone at 200,000 at that particular time, and acknowledged the \u2018terrible death rate\u2019 among those in East Africa. The primary responsibility of carriers was to carry supplies such as food and ammunition for soldiers on the front line. One young carrier, Nwoso, spoke of his recruitment and experience: Read full article: The carrier\u2019s tale Almost forgotten perhaps are the Chinese on the Western Front. Germany\u2019s new strategy of unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917 led to China eventually declaring war. Even before this, however, the country had been providing auxiliary aid to Britain. The Chinese Labour Corps was established to provide support, freeing troops for front line duties. By mid-September 1918 the Guardian reported that there were around 50,000 Chinese labourers making roads and rails, repairing machines and doing blacksmith and carpentry work for the allies. Retrospectively, the total number of Chinese and Vietnamese workers is estimated at more than 100,000 over the course of the war. Despite such a large contribution from non-white non-Europeans, racial prejudice and stereotypes contributed to an anxiety amongst many western nationals. In a column titled \u2018The problem of native races\u2019 on 18 July 1918, one writer discussed the difficulties that \u201cmust exist wherever two races of different levels of civilisation are brought into contact with one another.\u201d Amongst these \u2018difficulties\u2019 was the question of the war\u2019s after-effects. The writer expounded on people\u2019s fears: \u201cThe men of labour battalions may be and probably will be repatriated. But having come to Europe they and others will come again. Already there are more coloured men employed in Manchester and other great towns in England than ever before \u2026 Will English working men, in the bad days after the declaration of peace, be willing that natives should compete in the skilled and unskilled labour market?\u201d More recent commemorations have, however, endeavoured to create a deserved space for non-European soldiers and battlefields in the first world war narrative. In 2015, then president Barack Obama awarded the Medal of Honour to a Jewish and an African American soldier for their heroism on the French battlefields. This year, the last testimonies of Indian servicemen have been offered to the British Library, providing a better understanding of their wartime experiences and challenges. In the height of the war, the newspaper published an editorial: \u201cIf anything can be certain in this present time of doubt, it is that we shall never quite get back into the old groove after the war\u201d. The war had, after all, \u201cgripped ruthlessly into the lives of millions of men\u201d. It is only right to acknowledge that the men whose lives it affected extend beyond the battlefields and soldiers of Europe to over four million non-white men mobilised into European and American armies.

            "bodyText": "This gruesome film has arrived like some particularly nasty new version of Call of Duty, destined to be played for days at a time by a regrettable, and clearly unrepresentative gaming subset of pale, dead-eyed loners. It is a bizarre, and weirdly humourless and explicit action-horror fantasy set during the second world war \u2013 specifically just before the D-day landings, hence the title, derived from Operation Overlord, you see. It is written by Billy Ray (who scripted Captain Phillips and The Hunger Games) and directed by Australian film-maker Julius Avery, all working from an original concept from producer JJ Abrams \u2013 the idea being to make some money from a customer base which might loosely be described as incels and incel fellow travellers. It is June 1944 and Jovan Adepo plays Boyce, a young private in the 101st airborne division of the US army. He and his buddies are being parachuted into France on a mission to disable a radio tower positioned atop a church, thus disrupting the Nazis\u2019 communication network and assisting the Allied invasion on land. A more perfunctory and MacGuffiny plot device can hardly be imagined. But no matter. Having arrived in the nightmarish chaos of occupied France, Boyce and his Dirty Half Dozen prepare to approach this church, only to make a very strange discovery: that it is the site of Nazi medical experimentation, turning civilian prisoners into uber-soldiers in preparation for the forthcoming 1,000-year Reich. There is something deeply crass about this facetious nonsense, and everyone involved in this film might want to reflect that Nazi medical experimentation during the second world war did in fact happen, under circumstances other than these. It was a very real thing, not just a death-metal horror movie gag. Overlord leaves a very nasty taste in the mouth."

            "headline": "Reflections on the first world war and Armistice Day",
            "bodyText": "The poppy is now a matter of controversy. Some claim it is a symbol of militarism and a glorification of war. In the parlance of today\u2019s zero-sum dialogue, the poppy is tied to war, war is bad and should be ended, ergo sum the poppy is bad and should be eradicated. In a time when facts matter far less than feeling, this sounds like a convincing argument. So let\u2019s look at some facts. The poppy as a symbol of remembrance was promoted by an American educator named Moina Michael. She taught at the Lucy Cobb Institute, built in the 19th century to ameliorate the condition of women\u2019s education. She was inspired by the poem In Flanders Fields written by the Canadian battlefield surgeon John McCrae. While treating the wounded at the second battle of Ypres in 1915, which led to the obscene butchery and death of 123,000 people, he learned that his good friend Alexis Helmer was among the slaughtered. McCrea wrote his famous poem while still in the heat of battle. Michael was moved, as generations since have been, by McCrae\u2019s plaintive words. While teaching disabled servicemen in 1918, she began to agitate for silk poppies to be sold to pay for the basic needs of veterans abandoned by their nation after the guns fell silent, as is the case to this day. I am a veteran and the son of a veteran of the second world war. My father came home an empty shell of a man. Everyone who had known him said he was a different man. To this day, I relive the killing fields of the Yugoslavian slaughter in my dreams. The effects of my service caused me years of pain, homelessness and substance abuse. My son is three years old. I will use all the strength in me to ensure that he never knows the horror of war. I will do this by explaining its stark reality to him. I will bear witness. And that is where we, the veterans of Canada, are absolutely failing in executing our final duty. To bear witness, to speak with power and conviction against the scourge of war, and to act in our communities and societies to make this a reality. We need to stand up and share our pain as a warning. For those who don\u2019t wish to wear a poppy, I have a proposition. Some seem to think that soldiers don\u2019t understand the role of nation states, corporations and arms manufacturers in war. We always have. I ask you to bear in mind that the people who gave their lives did so in the belief that somehow their sacrifice could move humanity forward, would advance the causes of peace and universal rights, and move us to a day when we would live together in peaceful community. That, I would submit, is a noble goal even if you think that they were misled and mistaken in holding it. I propose that all of us live together in peaceful community, and every time we approach someone with whom we disagree, we treat them with empathy, humanity and respect and commit the only true act of remembrance that matters. When we do whatever small thing is in our power to advance the condition of those in our communities and build bridges of understanding and tolerance, we make their sacrifice a little more meaningful. And that is an act of remembrance that each of us can and should do every day. William Ray Nova Scotia, Canada \u2022 While we should certainly remember the soldiers who had their lives taken away (not \u201cgiven\u201d) in the first world war (Honour for last British soldier killed in first world war, 3 November), we should also remember the generals and politicians who caused their deaths. The first world war was a wholly unnecessary conflict that could not conceivably have brought any benefit to those fighting on either side. The utterly ineffective tactics used resulted in the inevitable deaths of millions, who were seen as entirely expendable. There is no doubt that those in charge were guilty of crimes against humanity and should have been tried for these instead of crying crocodile tears about how dreadful it was that so many were killed or injured. The fact that it is the Earl Haig Fund that sells the poppies is why I refuse to wear one. I\u2019ll remember those murdered in the trenches in my own way. Mike Scott Nottingham \u2022 In September 1914 Laurence Binyon wrote For the Fallen, a poem in which one line stands out from the routine patriotism of the rest. It reads: \u201cThey shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old.\u201d These words occur on war memorials up and down the land, and are often misquoted as \u201cThey shall not grow old\u201d (They Shall Not Grow Old review \u2013 Peter Jackson\u2019s electrifying journey into the first world war trenches, theguardian.com, 16 October). The misquotation is now given extra currency by the film of that title. It is of course obvious that the fallen will not grow old. How could they? But Binyon says they shall \u201cgrow not old\u201d (my italics) and he continues: \u201cAge shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.\u201d The implication is that they will grow in our collective and individual memories. It is a far more subtle and more moving thought than the misquotation. It is a pity that in this centenary year of the armistice, the IWM and 14-18 NOW (the WWI centenary art commissioners), who jointly commissioned the film in association with the BBC, could not understand these famous words and get them right. Chris Hall Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire Reflections on the pacifist movement Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de (For millions of Europeans, the war did not end in 1918, 7 November), should also remind us of the mostly unmentioned pacifist movement that became seriously motivated in the first world war. It was largely due to anti-war activists such as Fenner Brockway and his No Conscription Fellowship, and leading Quakers such as my grandfather, John Henry Barlow, that the 1916 Military Service Act, which made conscription mandatory, also included the so-called \u201cconscience clause\u201d, which for the first time enshrined in law the right of people to abstain from fighting on grounds of conscience. Then Philip Noel-Baker, again with Quaker support, organised the fledgling Friends\u2019 Ambulance Unit (FAU) in line with the society\u2019s historical peace testament. Altogether the FAU sent more than 1,000 men to France and Belgium, where they worked on ambulance convoys alongside the French and British armies. Before 1916 many conscientious objectors went to prison for their refusal to fight, but gradually after the act was signed, pacifism took on greater respectability and by 1939, when the FAU was reestablished by Paul Cadbury, hundreds of people of all faiths and none served with the unit in Europe, the Middle East, China and India, providing mobile medical units, helping house Polish refugees in Tehran, and caring for the sick and wounded in Kolkata. Wherever there is war, there are always the wounded and the FAU, often alongside the Red Cross, were there to care for them. As we remember the fallen, let us not forget those who helped the sick and wounded. Antony Barlow Sutton, Surrey \u2022 Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de states that Hungary lost \u201cmore than half of its population\u201d under the terms of the treaty of Trianon. Most estimates indicate that less than a third of Hungarians found themselves in the new or enlarged postwar nation states of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Romania. The passing of the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg empire was not mourned by previously subject nationalities. But it was a traumatic change of circumstances and self-image for the previously dominant Austrians and Hungarians. By now, Austria seems to have got over it; Hungary, less so. Anne Summers Honorary research fellow, Birkbeck, University of London \u2022 The war did not end for eastern Europeans in 1918. Part of the reason for this is that it did not end for those in the west either. Military interventions by the British into Russia, Georgia and Azerbaijan, by the French into Ukraine, and by the Canadians and Americans into Russia all continued well into 1919-20. Nigel Harvey St Albans, Hertfordshire \u2022 Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de\u2019s article makes the point that \u2018For millions of Europeans, the war did not end in 1918\u2019 but, among all the elements she lists contributing to the continuing destruction in eastern Europe (and beyond), she does not mention the invasions of the former USSR-to-be by the victorious empires seeking to feast on the remains of the Russian empire that, while losing in its theatres of the Great War, had prevented most of its allies from collapsing in theirs. Bryn Hughes Wrexham, Wales \u2022 Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de is undoubtedly right, but why does she make no reference to the Versailles treaty, and no mention of the continued allied occupation of the Rhineland into the early 1920s? Punitive war reparations were to prove useful for Hitler\u2019s interpretation of the Versailles diktat. Brian Stokoe York War was fatal even after battle ended George Edwin Ellison (Report, 3 November) may have been the last British soldier killed in the first world war. Sadly for my family, he was not the last fatality of that war. My grandfather, William Henry Garrett, served in the Royal Engineers on the western front from 1914-19, before returning home to his wife and three young children (one of whom was my father). William came back traumatised by his experiences in France and was diagnosed with shell shock. For the next 17 years my grandmother, Alice, cared for William as best she could and to her eternal credit succeeded in keeping him out of a feared lunatic asylum. Sadly, in 1936, William took his own life. He was 51 years old. William Garrett was only one of the many tens of thousands of men who survived the first world war but, damaged and often forgotten, went on to take their own lives. Jon Garrett London \u2022 My grandfather, George Kerswell, wouldn\u2019t have claimed to be a hero, but he was a sporting hero. He was part of the British expeditionary force interned by the Greek government in Salonika during the first world war \u2013 the so-called Gardeners of Salonika. Apart from gardening, the troops played football in their considerable spare time, and my grandfather was the only non-league player (he played amateur football in goal for Green Waves FC near his home town of Plymouth) to appear in an England v Scotland international in the camp. England won 2-1. It was the only thing he ever told me about the war. John Beresford Cambridge \u2022 The article Rail workers war memorial unveiled at London St Pancras (8 November) features the variety of occupations involved in railway service in years gone by. This can be seen to even better effect in a historic commemoration in Edinburgh\u2019s Waverley station. The 1920 memorial opposite platform seven consists of 10 steel wall panels listing the names of 860 dead, approximately one in six of those employees of the North British Railway who volunteered before the concept of reserved occupations was imposed halfway through the first world war. Nearly all the 860 served in the army and only 10 were officers. Their names are linked with their specialities, underlining the St Pancras artist\u2019s fascination with the occupations of working people \u2013 the NBR memorial records the sacrifice, not just of railwaymen, but engine drivers, canal banksmen, boiler washers and (curiously) strikers (wheeltappers perhaps?). AJ Mullay Author, Blighty\u2019s Railways \u2022 On a recent visit to Lancing College war memorial, it was good to see that the names of the non-teaching staff who died in the first world war have, albeit belatedly, been added. All credit to Lancing, as apparently this is not the case in every residential educational establishment and the commemoration in such communities of all the members who were killed is very patchy. The correction of this oversight is long overdue. What a valuable and enriching project it would be for students and staff to undertake the necessary research, which would lead to all those who lost their lives at last receiving proper recognition on these institutions\u2019 memorials. Nicola Brooker London \u2022 With 11 November marking the armistice centenary and in light of the controversy about wearing poppies, it is worth recalling the speech of James Connolly, the Irish socialist, which he made in the square in Tralee, Ireland, in October 1915. The occasion was a rally organised by Tralee Trades Council to mark the establishment of the first branch of the ITGWU (Irish Transport and General Workers\u2019 Union) in Kerry. More than 3,000 people attended the rally, and when Connolly addressed the crowd he made the following argument against Ireland\u2019s involvement in the war in Europe: \u201cI know that we in Ireland had never suffered one particular iota from any European power, but one \u2026 this war was not for Ireland, it was not for them no matter who wanted it. They stood for that section of the community who had fought the battles of the world and who had remained at the bottom no matter who was at the top. They would no longer accept the position of inferiority. They say not only are they part of the nation but they are the most useful part of it. No matter who sold Ireland in the past, the Irish working class never sold it, they always fought for it.\u201d It should also be noted that Connolly\u2019s anti-war argument was supported by the local branches of British-based unions affiliated to Tralee Trades Council, including the National Union of Railwaymen and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen. Kieran McNulty Tralee, County Kerry, Ireland A century on, lessons have not been learned As the nation prepares to acknowledge the fallen in military conflicts, the British government is threatening the survival of disabled war pensioners. A war pension is not a benefit, it is a military pension, awarded until 2008 to profoundly disabled members of British military forces for their sacrifice and service to the nation. Until 2008 any application for a pension review was acknowledged by the Veterans Agency with a medical examination, conducted by a former military doctor, who provided a detailed medical report on the deteriorating health of the disabled veteran. Any identified increase in failing health or disability saw an increase in the war pension. In October 2008 the fatally flawed work capability assessment (WCA) was introduced to assess all claimants of disability benefit, and to resist providing funding to as many as possible as the WCA disregards diagnosis and prognosis. As a consequence, war pensioners applying for a reassessment are confronted by a staff member from a corporate giant, who has no comprehension of military service. Most pensioners are refused any increase in their war pensions, and are warned not to apply again for future reassessment, which will not be considered regardless of failing health. As the nation\u2019s leaders lay their wreaths at the Cenotaph, war pensioners will be wondering why their generation of disabled veterans are treated with such disregard and total contempt. Mo Stewart War pensioner, former (W)RAF medical service, Wisbech \u2022 The defence minister, Tobias Ellwood, attended the burial of three unidentified soldiers found near Tyne Cot, and made some appropriate remarks. He also said that \u201c\u2026 there is a higher purpose for us to act as a force for good on the world stage\u201d. How does he reconcile this view with the support that the UK through his department is giving to Saudi Arabia in its merciless bombing of civilians in Yemen, including attacks on schools and hospitals, and the blockade that is contributing to starvation? We are providing manpower to assist with targeting and achieving record sales of guided bombs; so much for \u201cforce for good\u201d. If his comments are sincere can we look forward to a new moral and ethical defence and foreign policy? Douglas Simpson Todmorden, West Yorkshire \u2022 For British soldiers, the postwar period became a question of winning the peace as they returned to find no work and poor living standards. On 31 January 1919 in St George Square, Glasgow, the Clyde Workers\u2019 Committee organised a protest for a 40-hour week and jobs for returning soldiers. It was attacked by police, and the secretary of state for Scotland called it a \u201cBolshevist uprising\u201d. Some peace. Keith Flett London \u2022 Apologists for the slaughter of over a million British and Commonwealth soldiers in the first world war ignore the facts. The \u201cwar to end all wars\u201d did quite the opposite. It spawned European fascism and communism, precipitating the continent into the considerably more brutal and calamitous second world war, which in turn led to a 44-year-long cold war. The previous century of peace, 1815-1914, was swapped for a century of war, one that impoverished Britain, in the process destroying its superpower status. If Britain\u2019s intention in the first world war was to retain its power and contain Germany\u2019s, then simply look at the facts. Which nation now dominates Europe, which has the strongest economy and the greatest exports? Which nation is slinking out of Europe, tail between its legs, crying it has been bullied? If Remembrance Day means anything, it means we should stay in Europe. David Hughes Cheltenham Millions of lives could have been saved In all the remembrance of war dead some thought might be given to the rejection, led by France and David Lloyd George, of the German armistice proposals of late 1916. If the politicians had swallowed pride and properly negotiated this on the basis of the situation antebellum it would have saved millions of lives and maybe the disasters of Versailles and another world war. There are lessons here that have still not been acknowledged or learned. Peter Langworth London \u2022 Martin Kettle\u2019s argument is even stronger if one corrects his mistake dating reliance on US influence and support to the aftermath of the first world war. On the contrary, it was the US Senate\u2019s rejection of the Treaty of Versailles and, more importantly, the prospect of an Anglo-US security guarantee to France (and Lloyd George\u2019s duplicity in withdrawing the British guarantee), that in part undermined the halting start of a system of multilateral international institutions. We have been here before. Patrick Wallace London \u2022 I feel so saddened that we still fail to fully appreciate the 70 years of peace we have enjoyed between the European nations that were instrumental in the first and second world wars. There is no God-given right for us to continue living in peace with our closest neighbours and deal with the major problems that face us. The EU came into being as the successor to organisations formed to promote this cooperation. When concentrating on the rational arguments about trade and the economy it is far too easy to overlook the benefit that relative peace in Europe has brought. Stephen Hawkins Edinburgh \u2022 On my travels around the country in the last few years I have taken a moment to look more carefully than before at first world war memorials, which even the smallest village seems to possess. What intrigues me are the dates. It always begins in 1914 but ends sometimes in 1918, 1919 or even 1920. When did the war end \u2013 or are we still waiting? Nick Matthews Rugby, Warwickshire \u2022 There has been widespread commemoration of the centenary of the end of the first world war. I am wondering if in 1915, in the middle of war, the 100th anniversary of the end of the Napoleonic wars was remembered.

            "headline": "Thousands of Ypres sculptures to commemorate world war one dead",
            "bodyText": "Weeds are growing in a Flanders field. The straggly wild plants are sprouting through the newest first world war memorial in Belgium, one that offers a different way of remembering the conflict. Entitled Coming World, Remember Me, the work consists of 600,000 individual clay sculptures, one for each person \u2013 soldier and civilian \u2013 killed on Belgian soil during world war one. At the centre of the installation is a giant egg, to symbolise a new world. Allowing the weeds to grow is not a mark of irreverence, but a symbol of nature reclaiming the battlefield, according to Koen Vanmechelen, the Belgian conceptual artist behind the work. \u201cIt is not a monument like a war monument,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThis is a peace monument, and it is a reflection on whatever was and the desire of having a new world.\u201d The mass of tiny clay sculptures, spilling over parkland, offers a stark contrast to the immaculate war graves, maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Work began on the project in 2014, 100 years after the first world war began. Half of the sculptures were made by schoolchildren and volunteers, the rest by an artists\u2019 collective. Each was made in a mould to ensure consistent shape and size, but finished by hand, so no two are alike. Some have markings, or a sprinkling of sand baked into the clay. Others bear initials, names and occasional messages, such as \u201cWhy?\u201d. Each sculpture was funded by an individual donation of \u20ac5 (\u00a34.50), with half going to children\u2019s charities in Congo, Uganda and Zimbabwe. The tens of thousands of people involved in making the sculptures were given the name of the person it commemorated. The sculpture stands on what was no man\u2019s land, the scene of some of the most terrible fighting of world war one. It was in Flanders that armies used some of the war\u2019s cruellest weapons for the first time, such as mustard gas and flamethrowers. The once-blasted land is now Palingbeek park, 254 hectares of wood and grassland, fragrant with wildflowers. Sheep graze in the orchards. The park is criss-crossed with cycle lanes and walkers. Hints of the past are not far away. The tranquil ponds in the woods are shell craters, created by the pounding of the land that peaked in the battle of Messines Ridge. The frontline became stuck here in October 1914, part of a circle of trenches around the medieval city of Ypres, which was left in rubble. For almost four years Germany and the allies fought over the high sections of land in Westhoek \u2013 earthworks left by industrial projects of the nineteenth century \u2013 but the same clay soil that had doomed attempts to build a canal would later turn into the mud that made the terrain so treacherous for soldiers. The artwork is underpinned by a separate project to name every single person who died in Belgium during the first world war. \u201cWe felt we had to do it; you were often confronted with questions that you didn\u2019t have an answer for,\u201d says Piet Chielens, coordinator of the In Flanders Fields Museum, which has been drawing up the list of names. Many of those who visit the museum in Ypres are searching for information about a relative named on the Menin Gate, the monument to British and Commonwealth soldiers with no known grave. But people from 125 modern-day nations fought in Flanders, and visitors from other countries \u2013 especially France, Germany and Belgium \u2013 have similar questions, Chielens says. The registry of war dead is also correcting the historical record. Misspelled names and mistyped regiment numbers left gaps and confusion. Sometimes in the chaos of war, Belgian civilians were buried as unknown British soldiers. New information is emerging almost every day. \u201cThe counting never stops,\u201d Chielens says. The fate of the 600,000 sculptures after Armistice Day commemorations on 11 November is unclear, although the artist hopes they will find their way to museums around the world. Vanmechelen sees the work as a warning against forgetting: \u201cIt is very dangerous that we could easily create a new war if we don\u2019t know what war is.\u201d"

            "headline": "Transcription by Kate Atkinson review \u2013 second world war spying hijinks",
            "bodyText": "When we first meet Juliet Armstrong she is \u201cbadly damaged. Broken\u201d. She has been hit by a car while crossing the road after a Shostakovich concert. It is 1981, the year of a royal wedding, andJuliet is 60. \u201cIt had probably been a long enough life,\u201d she reflects as she lies on the London pavement. \u201cYet suddenly it all seemed like an illusion, a dream that had happened to somebody else.\u201d A couple of pages later we are in 1950: Juliet is on the brink of \u201cturning into that dreaded creature, a spinster\u201d, working in the schools department of the BBC, producing radio shows called Past Lives and Looking at Things, \u201cbringing Everyman to life through the ages\u201d. Juliet, we learn, was damaged long before the car incident, first by the death of her mother \u2013 \u201cthe only person who loved her\u201d \u2013 and then by \u201cthe wounds of war\u201d. Then it is back to 1940 (this wouldn\u2019t be a Kate Atkinson novel if it didn\u2019t play fast and loose with time), and we discover that Juliet worked for MI5 (after \u201cthat well-trodden path\u201d via Oxbridge and the BBC), recording meetings of British fascists and Nazi sympathisers \u2013 the transcriptions of the title. Her weapon is an Imperial typewriter. In addition to her structural inventiveness, Atkinson is celebrated for writing literary detective stories (the hugely successful Jackson Brodie series) and popular literary fiction (from her Whitbread-winning debut Behind the Scenes at the Museum to the Costa winners Life After Life and A God in Ruins). It follows that she should arrive at the spy novel, combining the puzzle-making of a mystery with the historical settings of her other fiction. Although Transcription does not belong with her recent twinned novels Life After Life and A God in Ruins, it is a historical continuation: where Life After Life began before the first world war, a halcyon era for well-to-do family the Todds, and A God in Ruins took us on heartstopping flights through the blitz, this latest book brings us into the war\u2019s drab aftermath. This is the London of pea soupers and tinned peas, where everyone is a casualty in some way. The fog is not there just to create mood (\u201cthat\u2019s all I need, Juliet thought \u2013 atmosphere\u201d); it symbolises the \u201cfog of obfuscation\u201d in which they are all operating. This is a novel about identity in which no one and nothing is exactly as they seem \u2013 a spy novel, in short. Despite Juliet\u2019s boast that she has \u201clearnt to read between the lines\u201d, she fails to see that her boss Perry, the object of her romantic fantasies, prefers to spend his time in the \u201cPink Sink\u201d or the \u201cRitz below the Ritz\u201d. And that\u2019s not all she misses. Bodies in the coal hole and strangling by Herm\u00e8s scarf \u2013 as Juliet reflects, this is espionage as \u201ca Girls\u2019 Own adventure\u201d, \u201ca bit of a lark\u201d. Invisible ink, secret camerasand miniature Mausers: all the toys in the spook kit are here (still shiny and new at this point in history). Not to mention the spies themselves, who come straight from central casting: chain-smoking debutante Clarissa (\u201cPa\u2019s a duke\u201d); hard-drinking femme fatale Giselle; fake Gestapo agent Godfrey with his trilby; and top dog Oliver, who has a rakish smile and good looks. Men in astrakhan-collared coats leave folded newspapers on park benches, strangers whisper in front of paintings in the National Gallery, London cabbies are in on the act. \u201cThere was always a man with a dog.\u201d Atkinson is clearly having fun. \u201cIt was a good idea for a plot but hammily executed,\u201d Juliet observes of a dreadful 1930s film, Death at Broadcasting House. And there is something unusually stagey about Transcription, with its fondness for italics, whispered asides and jaunty rhyming. At times this can make the novel seem as camp as the coffee. \u201cOh my giddy aunt, Juliet thought,\u201d as Perry looks as though he is finally about to make his advances. Did everyone really go around saying \u201cBlimey\u201d and \u201cHeaven forfend\u201d all the time? Then there are the cliches \u2013 \u201cLike a hawk ready to swoop on its prey\u201d; \u201cthe rats were in the trap\u201d; \u201cknocked Juliet for six\u201d ... Atkinson is too accomplished and careful a writer for this to be sloppiness, as Juliet\u2019s knowing riffs on cliche and metaphor suggest. This may be reading too much between the lines, but the countless references to plays, films and acting are hard to miss. \u201cIt was rather like a farce, Juliet thought, and wondered who would wander on to the stage next.\u201d The transcriptions she makes are laid out like scripts. And then there is Juliet\u2019s name. \u201cOh, bad luck,\u201d quips Clarissa on being introduced. \u201cI bet everyone is always asking you where Romeo is.\u201d Everyone is playing a role, and probably not just one. Terms such as \u201cpostmodern\u201d and \u201cmetafiction\u201d seem far too heavy for novels as enjoyable as Atkinson\u2019s, but from Behind the Scenes onwards she has been chipping away at the fourth wall, mischievously drawing attention to her craft. What elevates her fiction above mere playfulness is the emotional integrity of her characters. In Life After Life she kept reminding us of Ursula\u2019s fictionality, all the while making her seem more real; repeatedly killing her off, yet making her more alive to us. Here again she is signalling the artifice at work. Juliet\u2019s worldweariness and face-powder dry wit make her an affecting, engaging companion, but not necessarily one to love: she lacks the warmth of Atkinson\u2019s most compelling characters. After those opening pages, we never hear another word about her Italian musician lover or meet her son, her love for whom \u201chad been one of the overwhelming wonders of her life\u201d. Julietremains a mystery, which is, perhaps, the point. \u201cShe sometimes wondered if there was some emptiness inside that she was trying to fill, but, really, she suspected that she was just hungry a lot.\u201d \u201cI love endings,\u201d Atkinson has said, so much so that she often gives us more than one \u2013 in the case of Life After Life, seemingly endless endings. This tricksiness inevitably makes her difficult to review without revealing too much, and Transcription, which seems to begin at the end (remember Shostakovich?), is no exception. Some readers might find it simply slight rather than clever sleight of hand, but Atkinson always puts on a damn fine show. As Juliet is told, never forget the first rule of espionage: \u201cIf you are going to tell a lie, tell a good one.\u201d \u2022 Transcription is published by Doubleday.

            "headline": "Bells will ring out: world to mark end of first world war, 100 years on",
            "bodyText": "Before dawn broke over northern France on 4 November 1918, a 25-year-old British officer, Lt Wilfred Owen of the Manchester Regiment, headed out from a house in which British troops had been holed up in woodland near the village of Ors. The Hundred Days Offensive was nearing its conclusion and Allied victory was just a week away. Owen had written to his mother from what he called the \u201csmoky cellar\u201d of that house five days earlier to reassure her that he was in good spirits. He intimated that it would all be over soon. \u201cIt is a great life. I am more oblivious than alas! yourself, dear Mother, of the ghastly glimmering of the guns outside and the hollow crashing of the shells. There is no danger down here, or if any, it will be over before you read these lines.\u201d They were to prove prophetic words, though not in the way he had hoped. The operation that Owen was to take part in on the morning of 4 November was fraught with risk. The retreating Germans had dug themselves in on the other side of the Sambre-Oise canal that runs through Ors, and had destroyed its bridges and locks. The British troops began work at 5.45am, when it was still barely light; their objective that day was to build a floating bridge on which to cross the canal and push the enemy back towards the Belgian border. But they had barely begun before they came under heavy fire. As they worked to put in place the temporary crossing, both on the canal bank and on the water, many were gunned down. Owen fell while directing operations, shot through the head, either while on a raft or perhaps at the canal\u2019s edge. Forty soldiers were lost that morning and were buried in two cemeteries in Ors close to the canal. It is not known precisely when Owen\u2019s mother received her son\u2019s last letter, but it would have been close to, if not on, the date of his death. If it raised her hopes, it was not to be for long. A few days later, on Armistice Day, 11 November, as the church bells rang out to celebrate the end of the war in the Shropshire town of Shrewsbury, where the family lived, she and Owen\u2019s father opened the telegram every parent of a serving soldier dreaded, saying that their son had lost his life fighting bravely for his country. A hundred years later, on 4 November, starting at 5.45am, dozens of schoolchildren from the Manchester area will retrace the last walk of the first world war poet through the same woods, setting off from the same forester\u2019s house. The Maison Foresti\u00e8re has been reconstructed in honour of those who fell and was reopened in 2011 as a centre of commemoration, though with the cellar where they stayed, and where Owen wrote to his mother, left exactly as he described it. There will be music, specially composed, and a ceremony by the canal\u2019s edge. Further events will be held in Ors on 11 November. The village\u2019s mayor, Jacky Duminy, says: \u201cIt is important that everyone learns from the mistakes of the past. It will be very moving, yes. The young people have to know that these soldiers died for us to be free.\u201d Through his poetry, Owen has perhaps done more than any other victim of the first world war to articulate its horror and futility to future generations. The story of his end would hit the emotions with the same force today whoever he was, though arguably it has a particular poignancy because so many of us have been affected by his work, and know his face from collections that sit on our shelves. Owen\u2019s was, however, just one of 17 million military and civilian deaths that people this 11 November across the world are planning to commemorate. Those involved in organising the events often make a similar observation: that families and communities everywhere feel their own unique sense of involvement. They feel that this year\u2019s commemorations and celebrations will be for them and their loved ones, their villages and towns, as well as their country. \u201cWe see this all the time from people who come here,\u201d says Wesley Butstraen, the deputy head of tourism at the Flanders Fields Museum in Ypres, Belgium, which has seen visitor numbers soar since 2013. \u201cPeople come with their own stories, their own connections from their homes, and feelings of involvement. Almost every family has a link back to the first world war. There is a lot of emotion.\u201d Ypres, close to the front line and trenches, was flattened by German shells in late 1914 and early 1915, but was rebuilt brick by brick after the war. On Armistice Day, the town and region will be the focus of global media attention. When news broke in London that the war was finally over, the sense of national elation was almost uncontainable. For those like the Owen family, however, who had so recently received terrible news, to behold the joy all around must have been impossibly difficult. The Manchester Guardian of the next day captured the feeling and sounds on the streets of London. \u201cThen the church bells that we have never dared to ring but once on any great day of war, burst into a confident ringing. Big Ben over all, letting themselves go, like all London below them \u2026 Motor-cars in a steady stream came along, with people sticking to every inch of them like flies on treacle. \u201cInside might be a small selection of the Allies, some dark Italian officer with cameo face, a blonde English staff officer, a land girl on the bonnet, all mixed up with accretions of Australians wearing Union Jacks instead of their slouch hats, a gorgeous Indian in a turban and perhaps a bright blue Frenchman.\u201d The same report recorded ecstatic crowds converging on Downing Street where the prime minister, David Lloyd George, appeared and announced: \u201cI am glad to tell you that the war will be over at 11 o\u2019clock today.\u201d He waved, then disappeared inside, but the crowds bayed for more until he reappeared at the first-floor window of No 10, along with Andrew Bonar Law, the chancellor, and Winston Churchill, the minister of munitions. All this, the paper said, as \u201cthe housemaids of Downing Street waved their dusters and feather mops overhead\u201d. This year, Armistice Day will fall on a Sunday. Thousands of local events are being coordinated by the Imperial War Museum. And again the ringing of bells will play a large part. A careful balance will be struck between the solemn sound of remembrance and peals of celebration. Christopher O\u2019Mahony, president of the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, says he and others across the UK have been planning their contribution for years. \u201cWherever you have grown up, bells are part of the soundscape of the nation, whether it is a sound of joy as at a wedding or of sadness at a funeral,\u201d he says. In the early morning of 11 November more than 3,000 bell towers across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will ring out with the sound of \u201chalf-muffled\u201d bells, like a slow march, in solemn memory of those who lost their lives. Then, at midday, bellringers at each tower across the UK will remove the muffles from the clappers and at about 12.30 they will ring open. \u201cThe national mood swings then to gratitude and gratefulness and thanks,\u201d says O\u2019Mahony. Before 1914 the vast majority of bellringers in the UK were male, but the loss of so many men to war meant many more women took up the role. Today there are between 30,000 and 35,000 men and women bellringers in the UK, and still more are being sought for Armistice Day. The aim is that bells sound not just in the UK but across the world. The British and German governments are encouraging other countries to ring bells at the same times in the same way, expressing the reconciliation of former enemies in sound. \u201cBells will ring out across the world to replicate the outpouring of relief that took place in 1918, and to mark the peace and friendship that we now enjoy between nations,\u201d says the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright. Formal events in this country will include a march past the Cenotaph by 10,000 people, who can apply online to take part in a ballot to join the \u201cpeople\u2019s procession\u201d. There will be a service at Westminster Abbey and an international event organised by the Belgian city of Mons, likely to be attended by both the prime minister, Theresa May, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, near the place where some of the first and last battles of the 1914-18 war took place. That these events will have to be carefully choreographed to avoid diplomatic upsets between those who emerged victorious and those who went down to defeat 100 years ago goes without saying. The fact that they will take place just as the UK will be preparing to leave the European Union \u2013 a project launched after the second world war to cement peace in Europe \u2013 also escapes no one. Peter Slosse, the director of tourism in Ypres, who has worked for more than 30 years to bring visitors to the town, says: \u201cIt is something we are looking at with some regret. Will it be more difficult to travel here after Brexit?\u201d He sincerely hopes not. A few hundred yards away from the museum where Slosse works, three firemen sound the Last Post under the Menin Gate, as they do every night at 8pm in memory of those who fell. On a wet Thursday evening there are several hundred, mostly British, people standing silently under the giant structure, which bears the names of 55,000 soldiers who died in the Ypres Salient but who were never afforded formal burials because they were never found. Benoit Mottrie, chairman of the Last Post Association, says that, while the 100-year anniversary of Armistice Day will be a big event, the important thing is that time never forgets those who gave their lives. Like Slosse, he wants British people to keep coming to Ypres and insists the bugles will always sound at 8pm. Anniversaries come and go, but not the need for remembrance. \u201cWe have a duty under our constitution to have a permanent commemoration for these people,\u201d he says, throwing his gaze up at the giant arches and the huge long lists of names of the missing inscribed on them. \u201cThe 100 years changes nothing for us.\u201d 21 October 1915 Owen is enlisted in the Artists Rifles Officers\u2019 Training Corps. He trains at Hare Hall camp in Essex 4 June 1916 Commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Manchester Regiment 25 June, 1917 Suffering from shell shock, Owen is admitted to Craiglockhart war hospital, Edinburgh, where he meets fellow poet Siegfried Sassoon October 1917 At Craiglockhart, he writes first drafts of Dulce et Decorum Est and Anthem for Doomed Youth June 1918 Owen is judged fit to resume service July Returns to active service in France 1 October Owen leads units into battle near Joncourt, for which he is later awarded the Military Cross 4 November He is killed in action on the Sambre-Oise canal Kim Darragh"

            "headline": "Second world war pilot Mary Ellis dies aged 101",
            "bodyText": "Mary Ellis, one of the last surviving British female pilots from the second world war, has died aged 101 at her home on the Isle of Wight. She delivered Spitfires and bombers to the frontline after responding to a radio appeal by the Air Transport Auxiliary for female pilots. Ellis, n\u00e9e Wilkins, joined the ATA in 1941 and flew about 1,000 planes over the next four years, including 400 Spitfires and 47 Wellington bombers. After the war, Ellis moved to the Isle of Wight and managed Sandown airport from 1950 to 1970. She married fellow pilot Don Ellis in 1961 and continued to live in their home beside the runway at Sandown after his death in 2009. Ellis was awarded the freedom of the Isle of Wight earlier this year, and was described by the council leader, Dave Stewart, as a \u201cnational, international and island heroine\u201d. Other surviving female second world war pilots include Eleanor Wadsworth, who lives in Bury St Edmunds, Nancy Stratford, who lives in the US, Jaye Edwards, who lives in Canada, and Ethel Elizabeth Sharpe, who lives in Truro, Cornwall. Tributes have been paid to her on social media by fellow pilots including the Red Arrows flier Mike Ling. The TV presenter Dan Snow said he took his children to meet her last week, when Ellis shared her thoughts about the Spitfire. She described it as her favourite aircraft at her 100th birthday celebrations last year, saying: \u201cI think it\u2019s a symbol of freedom.\u201d The author and former RAF navigator John Nichol described Ellis as a \u201ctruly remarkable lady\u201d. The author and historian James Holland said it was \u201ctraumatic\u201d to see how fast Ellis\u2019s \u201camazing generation\u201d of pilots was slipping away. The youngest Spitfire pilot in the second world war, Geoffrey Wellum, who was 18 when he joined the Royal Air Force in 1939, died last week aged 96. The Battle of Britain pilot Tom Neil also died earlier this month, aged 97. Ellis was born in the village of Leafield, Oxfordshire, in 1917. The Royal Flying Corps had an active presence in the county, and Ellis enjoyed flying aircraft for pleasure up until the war began in 1939, and all civilian flying was banned in Britain. After coming to terms with the possibility of being unable to fly again for a long period, two years into the war, Ellis heard the ATA\u2019s appeal for female pilots. Women were allowed to fly military trainer and communications aircraft from 1940. A total of 168 women served in the ATA during the war; 15 died in the line of duty."

            "bodyText": "George Benjamin and the London Sinfonietta\u2019s Roundhouse Prom was dedicated to the late Oliver Knussen, who was closely associated with the Sinfonietta both as composer and conductor. The programme formed an austere meditation on the first world war, with Charles Ives\u2019 The Unanswered Question serving as a prelude to two great 20th-century works of ritual mourning \u2013 Igor Stravinsky\u2019s Symphonies of Wind Instruments and Olivier Messiaen\u2019s Et Exspecto Resurrectionem Mortuorum. At its centre, however, was a quartet of new pieces from composers representing four of the countries (Germany, Britain, Austria and Italy) that took part in the conflict. Hannah Kendall\u2019s instrumental Verdala commemorates the \u201cHalifax incident\u201d of 1916, when the SS Verdala, transporting troops from the British West Indies to Europe, was diverted north into a blizzard, before reaching Halifax, Nova Scotia. Many soldiers died of hypothermia or needed amputations due to frostbite. Kendall\u2019s scoring is sparsely effective: brittle high woodwind suggest the pervasive cold, while time percussively ticks away. The other pieces use a mezzo soloist \u2013 the excellent Susan Bickley \u2013 and deploy an expressionist vocal style that swerves between sprechstimme and lyricism. Georg Friedrich Haas\u2019s The Last Minutes of Inhumanity evoked distant sounds of conflict as Bickley declaimed a savage text by Karl Kraus. Isabel Mundry\u2019s Gefallen takes the German war poet August Stramm as the starting point for a study of the effects of trauma, in which the vocal line struggles to find meaning in the words. Luca Francesconi\u2019s We Wept uses a text by Dolly Shepherd, a driver with the Women\u2019s Army Auxiliary Corps in France, to explore the existential panic that set in when the guns of war suddenly fell silent. Benjamin conducted the premieres with his customary care and intensity, though it was elsewhere that he came into his own. The ceremonies of Symphonies of Wind Instruments were all biting clarity and palpable, if understated, grief. Benjamin studied composition with Messiaen and remains one of the great interpreters of his music; Et Exspecto, awesomely played, was genuinely overwhelming in its progression from darkness to its final contemplation of God\u2019s inscrutable majesty. Available on BBC iPlayer until 20 August."

            "headline": "'Very aggressive': Trump suggests Montenegro could cause world war three",
            "bodyText": "Donald Trump has drawn fresh scorn for attacking Montenegro, whose people he described as \u201cvery aggressive\u201d, suggesting the small nation could be the cause of a third world war. Days after a widely-criticised summit with his Russian counterpart, Trump\u2019s comments were decried as a \u201cgift to Putin\u201d. In an interview with Fox News, Trump also called into question Nato\u2019s founding principle. He was asked about Article 5, Nato\u2019s common defence clause which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all. \u201cWhy should my son go to Montenegro to defend it from attack?\u201d Fox host Tucker Carlson asked. Trump responded: \u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying. I\u2019ve asked the same question.\u201d \u201cMontenegro is a tiny country with very strong people ... They\u2019re very aggressive people. They may get aggressive, and congratulations, you\u2019re in world war three,\u201d the US president added. Montenegro, a former Yugoslav republic with a population of about 630,000, joined Nato last year, becoming is 29th member, a move that enraged Moscow. Its military numbers about 2,000 personnel. Montenegro\u2019s relations with Russia have deteriorated in recent years as the Balkan nation moved to join Nato. It also hopes to join the European Union, much to the anger of Putin, who sees the west perennially creeping towards Russia. Moscow has been accused of meddling in Montenegro\u2019s elections, and a failed 2016 coup was allegedly planned by pro-Russian militants. The Montenegrin prime minister, Dusko Markovic, said Trump\u2019s comment was \u201cnot in the context of justification of Nato\u2019s existence, but of Nato funding\u201d. \u201cHe replied to the question in which he said that the Montenegrin people are brave and that he does not want citizens of the US to fight and get killed for other Nato members states,\u201d Markovic told parliament late Wednesday in the capital Podgorica. The only time Article 5 has ever been invoked was by America after the 11 September 2001 terror attacks conducted by al-Qaida. Nearly 17 years on, Nato troops are still operating in Afghanistan after the US-led invasion of the country. \u201cTrump sows further doubt whether the US under his leadership would defend our allies. Another gift to Putin,\u201d Nicholas Burns, who was US ambassador to Nato after the 9/11 attacks, wrote on Twitter. Some observers derided Trump\u2019s claim that Montenegro is aggressive, recirculating online a video of last year\u2019s Nato summit where the US president appeared to shove Montenegro\u2019s prime minister aside at a photo shoot. Senior Republican leader senator John McCain, who has called Monday\u2019s summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki a \u201ctragic mistake,\u201d said Trump was doing exactly what the Russian strongman wanted. \u201cThe people of \u001dMontenegro boldly withstood pressure from \u001dPutin\u2019s Russia to embrace democracy,\u201d McCain said on Twitter. \u201cThe Senate voted 97-2 supporting its accession to \u001dNato. By attacking Montenegro and questioning our obligations under Nato, the President is playing right into Putin\u2019s hands.\u201d But the State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Trump has been unequivocal in his support of Nato\u2019s collective defence. \u201cThe summit declaration that came out at the end of the summit stated clearly that any attack against one ally would be regarded as an attack against all,\u201d Nauert said. Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, called Trump\u2019s remarks \u201cextraordinary\u201d. \u201cIt is not just that the president throws Montenegro under the bus; he makes the US commitment to Nato conditional and makes clear his discomfort w Article 5 and collective security, the core of the alliance,\u201d Haass wrote on Twitter."

            "headline": "Long-lost photo album of first world war soldier given to his family",
            "bodyText": "A long-lost photograph album, compiled by a soldier who set off for the first world war never to return, has been reunited with his descendants ahead of the Armistice centenary. Lt Henry Sacheverel Sanders pasted in family and military photographs, and annotated it with extracts from poems and musical scores, in the expectation he would die in battle, and so those who came after him could know about his life. He compiled it after the deaths of his wife, Nicola, aged 32, from TB, and two of his three young children: Peter, aged one, and Lorna, aged four. The album would be passed to his sole surviving son, Michael, who was just five when his father was killed in action at Achiet-le-Petit in France in August 1918. But Michael took it to his prep school, Fonthill in East Grinstead, West Sussex, and is believed to have lost it at some point. Now, through detective work by a local historian who found the album last year, and the Imperial War Museum\u2019s (IWM) digital \u201cLives of the First World War\u201d project, Sanders\u2019 grandchildren and great-grandchildren, who never knew the album existed, have been traced. The cloth covered scrapbook begins with the handwritten note: \u201cTo my son, and her son, Michael \u2026 that you might know what sort of people we used to be\u201d. Alongside is a quotation from Walt Whitman\u2019s poem So Long: \u201cCamerado, this is no book, who touches this touches a man\u201d. Sanders\u2019 granddaughter, Hilary Mead, a retired teacher from Oxford, said its pages reflected her grandparent\u2019s bohemian lifestyle, first in Ladbroke Road, London, and later in Caterham, Surrey, where regular visitors included Edwardian actress Cathleen Nesbitt and her fiance, the war poet Rupert Brooke. Sanders had trained at the Royal Academy of Music and was an outstanding professional musician and some time actor. He and his wife were so enchanted by JM Barrie\u2019s Peter Pan that Sanders took to calling himself \u201cPeter\u201d, signing the album: \u201cPeter Sanders, 2nd Lieut. 18 Royal War. R., Ipswich at 1917\u201d, which initially led to difficulties identifying relatives. As a widower, and the father of a young son, Sanders could, perhaps, have sought exemption from overseas service. The indications were, however, that he wanted to fight and was prepared to die. \u201cIt\u2019s what we believe, that he did not expect to survive and that also he did not expect my father to survive, because he was a delicate baby,\u201d said Mead. Overwhelming sorrow at the loss of his wife and children, and the passing of friends one by one, is reflected in the quotations, and may have motivated him to sign up. \u201cSeeing his whole world collapse, all the lovely things that had gone, I\u2019m just guessing, but perhaps the world was a very sad place for him,\u201d said Mead. Ann Hacke, Fonthill school\u2019s unofficial historian and an IWM volunteer who discovered the album among papers in storage, said: \u201cAs I was looking through it, I thought that this is someone who was writing this as a testimony with no expectation of coming back.\u201d Michael Sanders, who went on to become a solicitor in Norfolk, had attended Fonthill school aged 10. He later returned in the 1940s to briefly teach there, before serving in the second world war, and then taking up law as a profession. The school closed in 1985. \u201cHe may have lost it there as a boy, or if he took it back when he was a teacher there. We will never know,\u201d said Mead. Michael died aged 91 in 2004, survived by his three children, including Mead, and his six grandchildren. He had inherited his parents\u2019 musical genes, but had been able to share few memories of them as he was orphaned at such young age. Hacke\u2019s quest to trace descendants was initially thwarted because Sanders had used the name Peter. Using genealogy sites, she eventually discovered who the owner was, and she uploaded a photograph from the album, along with details, on the IWM site. Mead\u2019s son, named Henry in his great-grandfather\u2019s memory, came across Hacke\u2019s post while researching his great-grandfather, who died aged 35. Last week the family were presented with the album at the IWM. \u201cIt is incredible. We had no idea it existed,\u201d said Mead. She said it offered the family a much greater insight into the life of their grandparents. \u201cThe book gets to the heart of who they really were.\u201d Charlotte Czyzyk, project manager of the IWM\u2019s Lives of the First World War said: \u201cWe have had some fantastic stories over the years. I think to be able to reunite a family with an artefact that is as precious as this is really very special, and makes the whole project worthwhile.\u201d"

            "bodyText": "A UK cinema chain has rejected a short film highlighting the comfort some first world war soldiers found in the Bible. The film by the Bible Society was intended to be shown in 125 screens around the country in the run-up to the armistice centenary this weekend, but was vetoed by Empire Cinemas, which does not accept religious or political advertising. Over footage of soldiers in trenches, the three-minute film informs viewers that all British troops were given a Bible as part of their kit. \u201cTo many it was a source of hope, for eternal peace,\u201d reads caption material. The film moves to the present day, showing people reciting a passage from Revelation, customarily read at Remembrance Sunday services, as they go about their daily lives. They include a farmer, a fisherman, a hairdresser, a chef and a retired person. According to the Bible Society, the cinema advertising company Pearl &amp; Dean agreed to distribute the film. But in an email sent to the society last month, Pearl &amp; Dean said Empire Cinemas, which has 125 screens at 14 venues across the UK, had declined to show the film. \u201cThe reason for this is in the contracts with our exhibitors, they get veto over any sort of religious or political ad. I am sorry to deliver this news, but unfortunately they do get final say,\u201d said Pearl &amp; Dean\u2019s email. Paul Woolley of the Bible Society said: \u201cThe Bible is not a \u2018religious\u2019 document, just for Christians or just for \u2018religious\u2019 life; it\u2019s a book for everyone. It\u2019s an historical fact that the Bible was a core part of a British soldier\u2019s kit and that, to many, it was a source of hope. \u201cOf course Empire Cinemas is free to decide what they want to show or not. But we are saddened their customers won\u2019t get a chance to reflect on the role of the Bible, past and present.\u201d Kathryn Jacob, the chief executive of Pearl &amp; Dean, said the company had advised the Bible Society that cinemas had the right not to carry certain campaigns or categories. \u201cGiven the recent issues religious groups have had with some cinemas, we wanted to make this clear. One of the two companies approached decided not to carry this campaign, the other accepted it. This client then pulled the whole plan \u2026 [and] decided to make this situation public,\u201d she said. \u201cAt no stage had we said that acceptance was guaranteed. Cinemas must have the ability to run the content they feel is appropriate for the audiences they serve.\u201d Three years ago, the Church of England became embroiled in a row with three cinema chains that declined to show a 60-second film featuring the Lord\u2019s Prayer on the grounds it risked upsetting or offending audiences. Empire Cinemas has been approached for comment."

            "headline": "Trump to meet Putin and Erdo\u011fan during first world war ceremonies",
            "bodyText": "Donald Trump is to hold meetings with Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in Paris as world leaders arrive in western Europe for ceremonies to mark 100 years since the end of the first world war. The mood of Trump\u2019s two bilateral meetings, with the Russian and Turkish presidents, will be coloured by the outcome of the US midterm elections on Tuesday, and a decision, the same day, on whether to slap further US economic sanctions on Russia for using chemical weapons on British soil. The US Congress-mandated sanctions could be draconian and darken the atmosphere of a meeting that is already likely to create tension over the US decision to withdraw from the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty. By contrast, Emmanuel Macron, the French president and host for the armistice ceremonies in Paris on 11 November, hopes to use the emotion of the occasion to warn that a nationalist resurgence led by authoritarian leaders \u2013 an outcome of the flawed ending of the first world war \u2013 will threaten liberal democracies and the institutions of multilateralism, the chief outcome of the second world war. Macron has already expressed his fear that an atmosphere akin to the 1920s is now gripping Europe; his remarks were soon followed by a poll showing his En Marche! party trailing Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally party. The French president has emphasised his call for cooperation by inviting the outgoing German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to make the opening speech at the three-day Paris peace conference designed to showcase the practical and ideological importance of multilateralism, a theme he intends to put at the centre of next year\u2019s European elections. The Elys\u00e9e says that more than 100 foreign dignitaries representing states that fought in the first world war are due to attend the armistice ceremonies which will, on the instruction of Macron, be stripped of militarism. As many as 20 African leaders are also due to attend. Trump will find that the ending of the war in Syria, which has lasted seven years, will be high on the agenda of his meeting with Putin, as well as the new US sanctions to be applied from Monday on most importers of Iranian oil. Washington is predicting that the Putin-Trump bilateral will be brief, and not as controversial as their first such meeting in Helsinki in July. But the two men are unpredictable, and if Trump feels he has triumphed in the midterms, he may also think he has greater latitude in his relations with Russia. The expected Trump-Erdo\u011fan meeting will be the first since Turkey accused America\u2019s great Middle East ally, Saudi Arabia, of killing the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. America has been holding back from imposing any punishment on Riyadh pending the outcome of Saudi\u2019s own internal investigation into the murder. Erdo\u011fan has effectively accused the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, of ordering the murder. Saudi Arabia is not expected to be represented in Paris, while Erdo\u011fan also plans talks with Putin. Ironically, the Turkish president\u2019s previous visit to Paris in January was marred by his claim that journalists were \u201cgardeners of terrorism\u201d. At a joint press conference with Macron he said: \u201dTerror doesn\u2019t form by itself. Terror and terrorists have gardeners. These gardeners are those people viewed as thinkers. They water [terror] with the columns in their newspapers.\u201d Erdo\u011fan is likely to focus his time with Trump on preserving the ceasefire in Syria\u2019s northern Idlib province, on joint operations against Kurdish groups and on a further lifting of the US sanctions in light of improving relations. Merkel\u2019s speech opening the Paris Peace Forum will be her first significant international outing since she announced plans to stand aside as chancellor by 2021, adding to the sense that established multilateral voices were on the wane. The theme of the ambitious Paris peace conference, conceived in the wake of the optimism for liberal democracy sparked by Macron\u2019s election victory in May 2017, is the need for practical multilateral solutions to solve a common set of shared problems. Following Merkel\u2019s opening speech, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, is also expected to speak, calling for reformed multilateralism. Macron, who is due to spend the week visiting the frontlines of the first world war, is determined to draw contemporary lessons from the war\u2019s aftermath. In an interview with the Ouest-France newspaper Macron warned against complacency: \u201cIn a Europe divided by fears, nationalist assertions and the consequences of the economic crisis, we see in an almost methodical manner the rearticulation of everything that dominated life in Europe from post-world war I to the 1929 crisis.\u201d The Peace Forum, due to become an annual event, is designed as an antidote in the words of Macron, \u201cto the risk that haunts the world, of division, nationalism, and the great fears that can make democracy doubt itself\u201d. Put together by a prestigious group of intellectuals, led by Pascal Lamy, former head of the World Trade Organisation, the event is billed as \u201ca Davos for governance\u201d. It is focused on 120 governance projects and initiatives from around the world, selected from 850 applications, presented in five themes: peace and security, environment, development, new technologies, and inclusive economy."

            "headline": "When heroes of the first world war made playing fields out of battlefields",
            "bodyText": "It wasn\u2019t much of a cricket pitch, just a few yards of grass in Havrincourt Woods, but it was still the best on that stretch of the western front because it hadn\u2019t been bombed or shelled. George Harbottle opened the batting there. \u201cThe only trouble was there was saplings all about the blooming place like fielders,\u201d Harbottle remembered, \u201cand my first off drive hit a sapling, so I didn\u2019t get any runs off that. I think I got a four off the next one.\u201d Then a thunderstorm broke. Everyone bolted for cover, belly down under the wooden wagons. They never did finish. \u201cThat night, we were told to put all that stuff away: we were off at dawn up the line.\u201d The match was the first Harbottle had played since before the war. He felt the lack. He liked to say he\u2019d been born \u201cin sound of bat and ball\u201d because his house backed on to South Northumberland\u2019s ground. He\u2019d been supposed to play in a game for them the very day before war was declared, but the opposition never turned up. Instead, he wrote in his memoir, \u201cseveral of us sat there in the sunshine, and discussed what our personal action should be if, as already seemed certain, war would be declared next day.\u201d He decided to enlist, and did. He served first with the Northumberland Fusiliers and then the Machine Gun Corps. You hear a lot about the heroes. Men like Major Harold Thomas Forster, Distinguished Service Order and bar, Military Cross and bar, five times mentioned in dispatches, five first-class matches, 10 wickets at 21 each, nine of them in one game against the MCC. Forster won more decorations than any other first-class cricketer. Harbottle wasn\u2019t a hero, or any more of one than the millions of other regular men who served in the first world war. He was a shipbroker from Gosforth, who couldn\u2019t wait to get out of the army as soon as the war was over. Did he ever think of staying on after demobilisation? \u201cNot on your life. It\u2019s not up my street at all.\u201d There are only a few sports stories like Forster\u2019s, but there are countless thousands like Harbottle\u2019s. Which is why we don\u2019t often stop to tell them. But a hundred years on, the experience of the war never seems so close as it does when you read or hear about the men doing the everyday living of it. You can admire Forster\u2019s extraordinary story about charging the machine guns, but you can empathise with Harbottle\u2019s about trying to snatch an hour for a cricket match between rain showers. There are dozens more like it in the Imperial War Museum\u2019s archives, plain and honest, with no pomp or sanctimony. They\u2019re ordinary people\u2019s sport stories, like ours in many respects, utterly unlike them in many more. Harbottle was lucky, really. Cyril Dennys was with the Royal Garrison Artillery. At Amiens they were challenged to a match by a neighbouring unit of Australians. \u201cThey found a bit of unshelled ground within reach of their positions and ours. And we, or they, or both, got some equipment \u2013 bats and balls and bails and stumps \u2013 and we played cricket with them.\u201d The game went into the second day. \u201cWhat the Germans could have thought was going on, I can\u2019t imagine,\u201d Dennys remembered, \u201cbut it must\u2019ve been reported\u201d because \u201cunfortunately, next morning,\u201d the ground was heavily shelled. Frederick Goodman had a good one. He was a sergeant in the Medical Corps. \u201cI had a chap in my unit, a very fine chap indeed, but he was always giving everybody an awful lot of trouble.\u201d Goodman put him on fatigue duty. The problem was that they\u2019d arranged to play a game between the NCOs and regular men. The \u201cvery fine chap\u201d was out for revenge. He came charging downfield. \u201cI think it must have been prearranged so that he could do it \u2013 they didn\u2019t attempt to get it from him,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cHe ran the ball along the field and then he came down to the goal, I was keeping and of course he walloped the ball went into back of the net, and whacked Goodman through after it.\u201d At least Goodman was allowed to play. Clifford Lane was with the Hertfordshire Regiment at Givenchy. There was a bit of open ground there where they would play football. Sometimes stray bullets would fly over the pitch, but they were just far enough from the front line that the bullets were spent. So they couldn\u2019t kill you \u201cunless they\u2019d hit you in the right place.\u201d But the bullets weren\u2019t why the officers stopped them playing. It was because people kept getting injured in tackles. \u201cWell we mustn\u2019t get injured because we were wanted for attacks on the German trenches and that sort of thing. That was really a sort of a satire, really, wasn\u2019t it? I mean, you mustn\u2019t get injured playing football?\u201d Harbottle went back to South Northumberland cricket club, where he was a stalwart player and later president. He lived long enough to see the start of the Falklands war. When the fleet sailed out, he climbed Great Gable in the Lake District, to the high memorial of the Fell &amp; Rock Climbing Club. Later, he wrote a poem about it. It\u2019s called Again? \u201cAmong great gables boulders, on the cairn I must attend, are the names of those young climbers who too soon reached journey\u2019s end, they were fell and rock club members in the 14-18 war, is our modern world so stupid that it still must ask for more?\u201d"

            "headline": "Relief and reckoning: the first world war was over and Australia counted the cost",
            "bodyText": "It was mid-afternoon on the east coast of Australia when allied commanders and their German counterparts, after meeting for several days at the forest of Compi\u00e8gne in battle-devastated northern France, agreed to the terms that would end the first world war. The Germans and British signed the Armistice of Compi\u00e8gne between 5.12am and 5.20am on 11 November 1918, just as shift workers in the eastern coastal cities of Australia were heading home or into the pubs, and about lunchtime in the west. The German surrender had been anticipated. Revolution was under way in its cities, and the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires, and Bulgaria, had already been eliminated from the war. The Australian prime minister, Billy Hughes, meanwhile, was the subject of often negative news reports while, stationed in London, he haggled and hectored the British PM, Lloyd George, over the terms of the forthcoming peace and Australia\u2019s representation at the conference of Versailles. Indeed, almost from the moment on 8 November when the train carrying the German representatives crossed into France for the final negotiations, the word half a world away in Sydney was that the armistice had already been signed. As historian Joan Beaumont writes in Broken Nation \u2013 Australians in the Great War, \u201cIn Australia celebrations started prematurely in Sydney, where rumours circulated that the armistice had been signed on 8 November.\u201d Undeterred by the continuing pre-signing negotiations in Picardy, a festive atmosphere gripped Sydney over the whole weekend before the armistice, and peaked when confirmation of its signing reached the city in the mid-evening of 11 November. As the Sydney Morning Herald reported on 13 November: \u201cThe news, definite and official, that Germany had submitted to the armistice terms, came on Monday evening. Sydney, having benefitted by two full dress rehearsals, began forthwith to \u2018celebrate\u2019 \u2013 and has been celebrating with more or less continuity and thoroughness ever since.\u201d Tens of thousands of people poured into central Sydney from the suburbs on ferries, trams and trains. Despite the state government\u2019s anticipation of the armistice, there was next to no official celebration or provision for it on the evening of 11 November, as bands of musicians took it upon themselves to make impromptu performances and the crowds crushing into Martin Place and George Street broke into patriotic song. Indeed, it was as if the celebrating crowds came as a surprise to local officials. Impromptu arrangements to put an extra 150 trams on the tracks had to be made by Sydney\u2019s tramways department to cope with the sudden rush of commuters. This made little difference because the trams could not pass through the crowds on the biggest thoroughfares. All about Sydney the church bells pealed. Factory sirens wailed. Vessels on the harbour hooted their horns. Thousands of people waved (mostly British) flags, blew whistles and tapped on tin cans. Couples kissed and danced. Confetti rained down on the streets and, Beaumont writes, \u201ceffigies of \u2018Kaiser Bill\u2019 were hanged\u201d. Australia had, from a population of barely 5 million at war\u2019s outbreak in 1914, contributed heavily (though less so than other nations) to the British war effort. There was no conscription, yet more than 416,000 men volunteered and 331,000 were deployed, of whom 60,000-plus died. Another 155,000 were physically wounded while many more returned with the scourge of undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder. Patriotic fervour greeted Australia\u2019s entry to the war. But by 1918 Australia \u2013 having twice voted at plebiscite to deny Hughes the right to conscript more men for the war machine \u2013 was marred by bitter sectarianism and division over loyalty to the empire. While the rancour and division might have been forgotten for a night or two of revelry, they would return as Australia counted the cost \u2013 human, economic, emotional and psychological \u2013 of a conflict that had brought the 17-year-old federation to its knees and effectively crippled a large part of a generation of men. Sydney, a city of brazen beauty, of vivid harbour, clear skies, surf and yellow sands, partied hard for days. On 11 November the commonwealth declared that Tuesday 12 November was a national public holiday but, as the Sydney Morning Herald reported, \u201cthe state minister favoured Wednesday, and did not learn the federal intentions in time to alter the decision and give legal effect to a closing up on Tuesday\u201d. \u201cSo the upshot is that the people of New South Wales will have two holidays.\u201d The temporary capital of Australia in 1918 was still Melbourne (federal parliament did not open in Canberra until 1927), a city more introverted in character and European in style, externally at least, than the New South Wales capital. Melbourne did not start celebrating the pending armistice on 8 November. Indeed, the momentum for the celebrations that greeted the official announcement of the end of hostilities built slowly, even cautiously, through the late afternoon of 11 November. It is easy to imagine how news of the end of such a war would spread in viral fashion today. Twitter would be alive with rumours of an armistice and its terms, the negotiators under siege from media and news organisations competing to be the first to break any confirmed news of a settlement. It is harder to imagine how the news spread in the days before social media, widespread use of portable radios and home telephones, and television news. However, the newspapers of the day describe a type of social bushfire that roared through Melbourne from the offices of the Age newspaper in Collins Street when a cablegram from America, announcing the armistice, was posted on the board outside the building at 7.20pm. Only about 100 people were milling around the newspaper building, waiting for any news. The cablegram from Britain would not be posted until much later in the evening. On 12 November, the Age reported: \u201cMen and women looked up at the board as if they could hardly believe what they read. There was no immediate demonstration but in some mysterious way the news travelled like lightning over the city and its significance was quickly grasped. People came hurrying towards Collins street, spreading the news on the way.\u201d It was typical, perhaps, of the Melburnian temperament that \u201cdoubts were expressed as to whether the message had been actually received, and all were intent upon seeing the wonderful words in black and white\u201d. But soon, the paper reported, \u201ctelephone bells began to ring, and soon the exchange had to deal with a tremendous rush of calls\u201d. By 7.30pm the news had made its way to the Melbourne port, just as steamers were returning to dock. A sounding from the port\u2019s siren \u201cacted as the impromptu signal for a general celebration through the medium of steam throttles, for during the next half hour the bayside resounded to a giant chorus of siren-depot whistles of all types and tones\u201d. Passengers rushed into the city, joining tens of thousands of people who converged on the central business district by tram and train from the suburbs. The cafes emptied and closed while theatre performances were interrupted so that news of the armistice could be delivered to the patrons. At Her Majesty\u2019s theatre the news was given from the stage at the rising of the curtain, while actors and the band led the audience in renditions of The Marseillaise (sung in French), The Star-spangled Banner and God Save the King. Out on the streets the human crush resulted in wild scenes and some injuries to those who fell and were accidentally trampled. The crowd kept singing Over There, Keep the Home Fires Burning, Pack Up Your Troubles and Rule Britannia. The bells of St Patrick\u2019s cathedral in East Melbourne sounded all evening. But they could scarcely be heard against the din of the crowd. \u201cA spirit of abandon marked the whole night\u2019s proceedings, and the exuberance sometimes led to wild doings,\u201d the Age reported. As traffic slowed to a near standstill, such wild doings included the commandeering of several trams. According to the Age, \u201cSome irrepressible spirits ... lifted the vehicles from their lines, and carried or wheeled them to unaccustomed places and used them as vantage points from which to view the scenes in the streets.\u201d There were similar extravagant scenes of revelry in country towns and other cities across Australia. The war was over. But it was not the end of the terrible war news. For day after day, week after week, the newspapers would have front pages listing more and more names of the Australian missing and dead, some of whom lost their lives just hours or days before the ceasefire came into effect at the 11th minute of the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918. What did the soldiers think of the armistice? Beaumont writes, \u201cCertainly there was excitement and intoxicating joy. There was relief at having survived, but there was also a sense of loss, anti-climax, dislocation and anxiety about the future.\u201d For those whose relatives had died, the future was one of reckoning and grief \u2013 imbued with a range of other emotions, including pride. While researching his book Victoria at War, the military and social historian Michael McKernan came across the story of the service of commemoration outside Parliament House, Melbourne, on the first Sunday after the 11th. McKernan says: \u201cHuge crowds attended, but not Catholics ... they had their own pontifical solemn High Mass at St Pat\u2019s [cathedral] at which Bishop Phelan preached an objectionable sermon claiming that only Catholic soldiers could be certain of salvation. As a woman walked away from the affair a journalist heard her say to a friend, \u2018I lost seven nephews to the war, but I am so proud\u2019.\u201d"

            "headline": "11-11: Memories Retold review \u2013 a first world war game in which no shots are fired",
            "bodyText": "Creating a commemorative first world war game is bold, given the traditionally blunt approach to warfare that video games have, but boldness is to be expected of Wallace and Gromit creators Aardman Animations. The mission of 11-11: Memories Retold, released before the centenary of Armistice Day, is to provide insight into the war, particularly for younger generations. Aardman Animations\u2019 first full-length game takes an impressionistic approach, with its visuals \u2013 which employ a \u201cliving painting\u201d effect inspired by the likes of Turner and Monet \u2013 seeming to boil and flow. It is a clever ploy, and is in keeping with the game\u2019s contemplative tone. The game avoids explicit bloodshed, but still communicates the grim nature of trench life. It also heightens your attention to the story, which has a fable-like quality, as if vividly but distantly remembered. The game follows two characters on opposing sides of the war: Canadian Harry and German Kurt. Neither is at war when the story starts in November 1916: Harry is working in a Toronto photography shop and Kurt in a zeppelin factory. But Harry is recruited by the somewhat narcissistic Major Barrett to take photographs at the front. Meanwhile, Kurt, who is tormented by the fear that his son Max may have been killed at the front, enlists in order to find him. Neither protagonist wields a gun, uniquely for a first world war game. Harry is a photographer, Kurt an engineer. Their stories unfold, month by month \u2013 and eventually become entwined. The game takes in various locations, most notably Vimy and Passchendaele. It is by no means an action game. Harry takes photos, Kurt fixes radios and eavesdrops on the enemy from spy tunnels dug beneath trenches. Sometimes they work together in occasionally clunky, laborious puzzles. There\u2019s a lot of walking around, taking in the atmosphere and, often, trying to figure out what to do next; there are no maps or icons urging you towards an objective. Talking to people and making conversational choices influences the story and the ending, and you must choose what Kurt writes in his frequent letters to his wife and daughter at home. As the pair edge closer to the fighting, the gameplay escalates; you might, for example, have to duck and dive to avoid snipers or time runs according to when machine-gunners are reloading, and there are some stealth sequences. What you do is tightly constrained by the story, the real point of the game, which makes a good fist of capturing the essence of what it must have been like to fight in the war from two novel, non-combatant perspectives. The game, which comes in at roughly six hours, illuminates the subject of the first world war with sensitivity and poignancy while covering an awful lot of ground. It also offers a good snapshot of prevailing sensibilities, some of which may shock younger players. While musing on the futility and psychological effect of war and how loss can affect a person, it manages to avoid becoming too heavy or overbearing \u2013 which is quite an achievement. For those who think they don\u2019t know enough about the war, 11-11: Memories Retold paints a picture of the time. Aardman Animations, development partner DigixArt and publisher Bandai Namco have harnessed the power of video games to create a fitting accompaniment to the centenary of Armistice Day. 11-11: Memories Retold is released on 9 November; \u00a324.99."

            "headline": "Poppy appeal has raised \u00a31 every second since first world war",
            "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s poppy appeal has raised nearly \u00a33bn in today\u2019s money in the 100 years since the end of the first world war, the Guardian has established, making the yearly autumn fundraiser one of the most successful street donation campaigns in the country\u2019s history. People have given on average \u00a31 every second for an inflation-adjusted amount of \u00a32.89bn since the appeal fund was launched in 1921. Fundraisers say this armistice centenary year could bring in record donations of more than \u00a350m. More than \u00a31bn has been raised in the past 25 years alone, comparable to totals raised by Comic Relief and Children in Need respectively since their establishment in the 1980s. The appeal remains controversial, however. The newsreader Jon Snow refused to wear a poppy on air in 2006, decrying what he called \u201cpoppy fascism\u201d, and in 2016, Fifa banned the England team from wearing them in World Cup qualifiers. This week, the Novara Media co-founder and Labour supporter Aaron Bastani called the poppy appeal \u201csickening\u201d, saying \u201cas a country, Britain spends \u00a345m on poppies to feel good and help a worthy cause, while 13,000 ex-veterans are homeless\u201d. Despite the charged debate, there has been the biggest spike in donations in the past decade since the end of the second world war. The money raised has gone to veteran care homes, family respite and advisory services, among other causes. More recently, with the realisation of the scale of mental health problems among military personnel following campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, attention is turning to mental health through the likes of Forward Assist, a Newcastle-based charity that helps with social integration of veterans. The proportion of personnel with a diagnosed mental health condition has almost doubled in the past decade. Lisa Gordon, 46, joined the army in 1990 and served for 11 years in Northern Ireland and Bosnia, before being medically discharged due to injuries and going on to experience social isolation and depression. \u201cIt was my own pride that was stopping me from accessing support,\u201d she said, adding that Forward Assist helped her turn things around. \u201cI was scared of people judging me, but as soon as I walked through the door there was no judgment whatsoever. I was among people that understood me. They put me back together and helped me find myself again.\u201d Through group activities including nature walks and fishing, Gordon was able to connect with others who had had similar experiences. \u201cThe other veterans understood depression,\u201d she said, \u201cand a lot of the females were socially isolated too, so we helped each other\u201d. Like Gordon, Bob Wilson also volunteers for Forward Assist. He experienced bouts of depression following 16 years of service, starting in Northern Ireland. \u201cI saw some horrible things which play over in my mind, like when you see your best mate blown to pieces by a bomb and then you have to kill the dogs to stop them from running away with the bones. That\u2019s not a nice thought to go through your head. \u201cI do whatever they [Forward Assist] need me to do \u2013 driving or going fishing \u2013 as long as I\u2019m doing something, I\u2019m not thinking. We\u2019re very grateful for the help the poppy appeal gives because places like Forward Assist have given me a community.\u201d Royal British Legion research found veterans are twice as likely to become unemployed than civilians, resulting in about 120,000 being currently out of work. The Officers\u2019 Association, which receives 60% of its money from the poppy appeal, has set up an employment app to help veterans find new careers, with almost 2,000 registering for assistance each year. One such former officer is Anthony Thompson, 31. After joining the Royal Marines in 2008 and completing two tours of Afghanistan, Thompson sustained an injury and was medically discharged in 2017. \u201cI had a really awful transition from the military,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel supported. I applied to 256 positions over the seven months that I was unemployed and was unsuccessful in all of them.\u201d A veteran friend recommended Thompson contact the Officers\u2019 Association. \u201cI started networking through the OA and things started turning around for me then \u2026 luckily I reached out before things went too far,\u201d he said."

            "headline": "The animal victims of the first world war are a stain on our conscience",
            "bodyText": "They are the truly forgotten dead. Sixteen million animals \u201cserved\u201d in the first world war \u2013 and the RSPCA estimates that 484,143 horses, mules, camels and bullocks were killed in British service between 1914 and 1918. Some died before they reached the western front: of 94,000 horses sent from North America in 1917, 2,700 drowned when their vessels were sunk by submarines. Trench dogs hunted for rats in the trenches. Others carried messages. The German army alone employed 30,000 dogs. In a canine echo of War Horse, dogs were recruited from animal shelters, and when that supply ran out, from the general public. \u201cI have given my husband and my sons,\u201d wrote one English woman, \u201cand now that he too is required, I give my dog.\u201d In no man\u2019s land, dogs did jobs humans could not, such as taking supplies to the wounded so that they could treat themselves; and \u201cmercy dogs\u201d would stay with dying soldiers to keep them company. Such stories bear witness to the loyalty of animals. Dick, a black retriever messenger dog, was wounded in action but recovered enough to resume his duties. He developed a limp, grew weaker, and had to be put down. A postmortem showed that he\u2019d been working with a bullet lodged in his chest and a shell splinter close to his spine. Other animals acted as canaries in the mine. One South African unit had a baboon called Jackie with sharp hearing, who would tug at men\u2019s sleeves if he detected enemy advances. Slugs were used when it was discovered they would visibly demonstrate their discomfort in the presence of mustard gas in smaller quantities than humans could sense, allowing soldiers to don their gas masks in time. Some animals may have been grateful for more placid roles. At the vast military hospital at Netley on Southampton Water, where thousands of shell-shocked troops were treated \u2013 including the poet Wilfred Owen \u2013 donkeys were employed to calm men suffering from PTSD. On ships, dogs, pigs and even magpies became animal spirits to deflect the stress of war. Around 100,000 pigeons served, too. One delivered a message from a US battalion trapped behind enemy lines: \u201cOur artillery is dropping a barrage directly on us. For heaven\u2019s sake stop it\u201d. The birds\u2019 work was so important that they were protected by the Defence of the Realm Act, which criminalised any attempt to kill or maltreat them. It was an ironic implementation of animal rights to mirror the first conservation law in Britain, introduced by the 8th century saint, Cuthbert, who declared that the eider ducks of the Farne Islands should be protected; ironic because during the war, huge rafts of eiders at rest in the North Sea were used by the RAF for target practice. Whales were used for the same purpose. It was the first time cetaceans had been seen and photographed from the air. One account noted, \u201cIn the half-lights, these huge monsters bore a strong resemblance to a submerged U-boat, and, as the rule in war was, \u2018When in doubt, bomb\u2019, a good many of them were killed by our aircraft.\u201d Meanwhile, 175,000 whales died in the South Atlantic to furnish rifle oil, fuel for trench stoves and oil to protect against trench foot. Germany culled dolphins and seals for their oil. Whales were also co-opted to deal with food shortages: as Michael Freemantle notes in his book The Chemists\u2019 War, Lever Brothers had worked out how to hydrogenate whale oil to make it fit for human consumption. Most terribly, these placid animals were processed into munitions themselves as their bodies yielded glycerine for bombs. It wouldn\u2019t be until later in the century that humans employed cetaceans in war, but even in the postwar period, consciences were stirring. In a 1924 essay entitled The Impudence of Flags: Our Power Resources and My Elephants, Whales and Gorillas, HG Wells, prophetic author of The War of the Worlds, wrote: \u201cThe dwindling world fauna of this planet is in urgent need of international game laws and a supernational game-keeper. Species of whales are being exterminated because the ocean is no man\u2019s land.\u201d In the fitful periods of peace in the last century, there was no armistice for animals, and monuments to their efforts are few, London\u2019s Park Lane memorial being a noble exception. One hundred years after the first war of the anthropocene, itself a perversion of nature and fought for the Earth\u2019s resources, these non-human casualties remain as an indelible stain on our conscience. \u2022 Philip Hoare is an author.

            "headline": "'It was very hard for him': relatives remember first world war survivors",
            "bodyText": "Their stories will endure, safeguarded by their descendants. One hundred years after the guns fell silent on the western front, children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and other relatives of those who fought in the first world war will be among the 10,000-strong crowd expected to march past the Cenotaph in the People\u2019s Procession on Remembrance Sunday. Mark Rogers will march for his grandfather Lewis Rogers, a gunner who survived the war, but whose brother Bertie did not. Bertie was one of three of Rogers\u2019s great-uncles who died in the war. \u201cAll were young men. As Lewis said: \u2018There was no old men there,\u2019\u201d said Rogers, a maths teacher from Solihull. Julia Knowles will also walk for her grandfather Arthur Hines, a signaller who survived the war and went back to France to find and marry the young French woman who captured his heart in Lille. She will have in mind a \u201cheart-rending\u201d letter Hines had carried all his life. It was written to him by the grieving mother of a serving comrade who did not come home, in which she consoles herself her son had \u201cdied for a great and noble cause\u201d. Fighting continued up to the moment of armistice, at 11am on 11 November 1918, with some soldiers killed just minutes before hostilities officially ended. To mark the centenary, the president of Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, will become the first German leader to lay a wreath at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, a historic act of reconciliation. Bells will ring across Britain and abroad after the Cenotaph service, to echo the spontaneous outpouring on 11 November 1918, and 10,000 people chosen by ballot, including the descendants of those who fought, will march past in tribute. \u201cNow the two world wars of the last century are passing from living memory,\u201d said Rogers. \u201cEven this event \u2013 the People\u2019s Procession \u2013 is driven by the fact that veterans of these wars have all but disappeared. What do we do next? Abandon the march past the Cenotaph at Whitehall, or adapt it? \u201cI want to march past in the place of those who used to remember their comrades who had fallen; men who knew the men who had died, and were thankful that they had survived.\u201d His grandfather, from Crowle in Worcestershire, was one of four brothers, all of whom fought. He and Bertie both joined the Worcestershire Regiment and were posted to France in March 1915. By August 1915, Bertie was dead. Lewis Rogers would go on to survive the Somme and was shot in the ankle during the Battle of Aisne. He rarely spoke of the war, his grandson said. \u201cHe used to say: \u2018If you were there, you wouldn\u2019t want to talk about it.\u2019\u201d It was bad enough to have a brother killed, he said. \u201cBut then to have to come back and tell your mother about it, that was very hard for him.\u201d Only towards the end of his life did Lewis Rogers open up, allowing his grandson to record his memories. \u201cI asked him whether he ever thought about the many men he must have killed. He replied: \u2018I suppose I did. You couldn\u2019t miss \u2019em. It was like shooting into a wall of cattle.\u2019\u201d \u201cI think they had to sanitise it, to come to terms with it. It was just doing a job, basically,\u201d said Rogers. It kindled a fascination with the war for Rogers, who researches local memorials. \u201cWhy? Because in war ordinary men do extraordinary things. War opens a window on the soul of mankind, and through that window we see him at both his best and worst.\u201d Knowles, from Chaldon in Surrey, was so moved by the letter written to her grandfather, who was from West Ham in east London and served with D/181 Brigade in the British expeditionary force, that she recently sought out the grave of his comrade, William Munro Hutchinson, from Bolton. The men\u2019s friendship was forged in the war. When Hutchinson died aged 24, Hines wrote to his parents, and his comrade\u2019s mother wrote back. \u201cIt must have meant a lot to my grandfather,\u201d said Knowles, an operations manager at a satellite communications company. \u201cHe kept it all his life. But we knew nothing about it until my father died, and we found it in his personal effects.\u201d Knowles will also celebrate the more \u201cjoyous\u201d consequence of the war in that it brought her grandparents together, and the close links she retains today with her French grandmother\u2019s family. \u201cWhen I walk in the People\u2019s Procession with my husband, I expect it to be a day of mixed emotions as I will be giving thanks for how my own family has evolved, while also remembering that our lives would not have been possible without the sacrifice of others like William. \u201cIf you read that letter, it is heart-rending. It says that he died for a great and noble cause. If you are a parent, and you lose your son like that, and you have the courage to say \u2018he died for a great and noble cause\u2019, that is something, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said. Transcript of the letter Dear Mr Hines We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your kind letter. We are all deeply touched, coming from a chum out there of our dear lad. We are deeply grateful for your eulogy to him. Yes he was one of the best, same as the Secretary of the orchestra said, his musical abilities were of a high order, and they all loved him for his pleasant, joyous disposition, his comradeship, to make everyone he came in contact with happy. It has all seemed a hideous nightmare to us all, we can scarcely realise it. It came so sudden, just after leaving us, and his last words were \u201cI\u2019ll come back\u201d. Alas it was not to be. We shall have to try and fortify ourselves with the thought that he has died for a great and noble cause. The lad you mentioned did pay a visit. I am sorry I was out. He told them the circumstances how it happened. I also received a letter from the Major Com Nesham, Chaplain Doll, and I/C Flower at the Hospital, informing us of his last moments, and where he is buried : Hilibary Cemetery, Grave 6, Row 3, Plot 2, Boyelles. Dear Friend, we sincerely hope the Battery will have the good fortune to carry on unharmed, and will soon be restored to your dear ones. Please convey our thanks and gratitude to all concerned signallers, etc. We remain yours sincerely, Mr and Mrs Wm Hutchinson."
