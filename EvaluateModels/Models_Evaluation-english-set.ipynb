    "Here, you can clearly see how important the clustering alg. is for obtaining good results: the data-set is (objectively) okay, it has more than enough words, and each model gets a pretty high Precision score, which means that (almost) every document that is put together rightfully belongs to the same cluster, as you can see in the clusters; the 'problem' is that we're splitting clusters too much, finding meaningful, but somewhat unecessary sub-clusters, very specific to a single topic, which is not a bad thing.. it means that by tweaking that 'eps' we can get pretty different results.. is there a way to choose the eps value automatically?"
